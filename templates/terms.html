  <h2>2. Nature of Service</h2>
  <p>Signal Hawk provides educational buy and sell signal alerts for S&amp;P 500 and SPXL-based investment strategies. Our service is informational and educational in nature. We are <b>not</b> a registered investment adviser, broker-dealer, or financial planner under any federal or state securities law.

  <h2>3. Subscription &amp; Billing</h2>
  <p>Subscriptions are offered on a monthly, yearly, or multi-year basis at the rates displayed on our signup page. Payment is processed securely through Stripe, Inc. Monthly and yearly subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled before the next billing period. Multi-year plans are billed as a one-time payment and do not auto-renew.</p>
  <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through the Account dashboard billing portal. Cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period. We do not offer refunds for partial billing periods.</p>

  <h2>4. User Accounts</h2>

We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any signals, data, or content provided.</p>

  <h2>9. Modifications</h2>
