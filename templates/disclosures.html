  <h1>Important Disclosures</h1>
  <div class="date">Last Updated: January 15, 2026</div>

  <h2>Regulatory Status</h2>
  <p>Signal Hawk Capital, LLC is <b>not</b> a registered investment adviser, broker-dealer, or financial planner under any federal or state securities law. We do not provide personalized investment advice, nor do we manage client accounts or discretionary portfolios.</p>

  <h2>Educational Purpose</h2>
  <p>All content, signals, alerts, and analysis provided through our service are for educational and informational purposes only. Our buy and sell signal alerts are based on quantitative models applied to publicly available market data. They should not be interpreted as recommendations to purchase, sell, or hold any particular security.</p>

  <h2>Investment Risks</h2>
  <p>Investing in securities involves significant risk, including the potential loss of your entire invested capital. Key risks associated with strategies discussed in our service include:</p>
  <p><b>Market Risk:</b> The value of investments can decline due to broad market conditions, economic downturns, geopolitical events, and other factors beyond anyone's control.</p>
  <p><b>Leveraged ETF Risk:</b> Our strategies reference leveraged exchange-traded funds such as SPXL (3x S&amp;P 500). Leveraged ETFs are designed for short-term trading and carry additional risks including daily compounding effects (volatility decay), amplified losses during market declines, and potential for significant underperformance relative to the underlying index over extended periods.</p>
  <p><b>Model Risk:</b> Our signal models are based on historical data and quantitative analysis. Past model performance does not guarantee future accuracy. Models may fail during unprecedented market conditions, structural market changes, or periods of extreme volatility.</p>
  <p><b>Timing Risk:</b> Signal alerts are generated at specific points in time. Execution delays, market gaps, slippage, and liquidity conditions may result in materially different outcomes than what the model indicates.</p>

  <h2>Past Performance</h2>
  <p>Past performance of the Signal Hawk Strategy or any other strategy presented on our platform is not indicative of future results. Backtested performance shown in our Investment Growth Analyzer is hypothetical, was not achieved through actual trading, and has inherent limitations. Backtested results do not account for all real-world factors such as commissions, bid-ask spreads, market impact, or behavioral biases.</p>

  <h2>Tax Considerations</h2>
  <p>Tax implications of investment strategies vary based on individual circumstances, holding periods, and jurisdiction. Our service does not provide tax advice. Subscribers should consult a qualified tax professional regarding the tax consequences of any investment decisions.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Data</h2>
  <p>Market data displayed on our platform is sourced from third-party providers and is believed to be reliable but is not guaranteed for accuracy or completeness. Signal Hawk Capital is not responsible for errors or omissions in third-party data.</p>

  <h2>No Guarantee</h2>
  <p>Signal Hawk Capital does not guarantee any specific investment outcomes, returns, or performance levels. You are solely responsible for your own investment decisions and should only invest money you can afford to lose.</p>

  <h2>Consult a Professional</h2>
  <p>We strongly recommend that you consult with a qualified, registered financial advisor, tax professional, and/or attorney before making any investment decisions. Our service is not a substitute for professional financial advice tailored to your individual situation, goals, and risk tolerance.</p>
