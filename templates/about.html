  <h1>About Signal Hawk Capital</h1>
  <p>Signal Hawk Capital is a research and data-driven technology company focused on Machine Learning (ML) and adaptive rules-based long-term trend investing.</p>
  <p>Our proprietary models analyze decades of market data to generate systematic buy and sell signals on the S&amp;P 500 and SPXL. The goal is straightforward: participate in durable uptrends and move to cash when major selloffs begin.</p>
  <p>We believe individual investors deserve access to the same quantitative tools used by professional firms — without the complexity or high fees. Signal Hawk distills sophisticated analysis into clear, actionable alerts delivered straight to your inbox or phone.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:36px;">Our Approach</h2>
  <p>Signal Hawk's strategy is grounded in price-trend regime detection — identifying when the broad market is in a favorable environment for equity exposure and when it is not. We use a combination of moving average crossover signals, volatility filters, and machine-learning-enhanced regime classification to generate timely buy and sell alerts.</p>
  <p>This isn't day trading or market timing in the traditional sense. Our signals are designed for long-term investors who want to stay in the market during sustained uptrends while systematically reducing exposure during major declines — the kind that can set portfolios back by years.</p>
