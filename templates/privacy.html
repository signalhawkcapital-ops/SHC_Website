  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><b>Information you provide directly:</b> When you create an account or subscribe, we collect your email address, phone number, and name (if provided). We do not directly collect or store payment card information — all payment processing is handled securely by Stripe, Inc.</p>
  <p><b>Information collected automatically:</b> When you visit our website, we may collect standard log data such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, referring URL, pages visited, and timestamps. This data is used for security monitoring and service improvement.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information to: deliver signal alerts via email and SMS; process and manage your subscription; provide customer support; send important account communications (setup links, password resets, billing notifications); and improve our service. We may also send occasional product updates or educational content related to our service, which you can opt out of at any time through your Account settings.</p>

  <h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do <b>not</b> sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties. We share information only with service providers necessary to operate our platform:</p>
  <p><b>Stripe, Inc.</b> — for payment processing and subscription management. Stripe's handling of your payment data is governed by <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  <p><b>Email/SMS providers</b> — to deliver signal alerts and account communications.</p>
  <p>We may also disclose information if required by law, legal process, or to protect the rights, safety, or property of Signal Hawk Capital, our users, or the public.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information. Passwords are stored using industry-standard one-way cryptographic hashing. All data transmission between your browser and our servers is encrypted via TLS/SSL. However, no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide our services. If you cancel your subscription, we retain your information for a reasonable period to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. You may request deletion of your account data by contacting us at the email below.</p>
